# Monotonic subsequence Project
# Overview
This Java program analyzes a sequence of integers from a specified input file to determine the longest increasing and decreasing subsequences. It calculates both the length and the sum of these subsequences. The program is designed to provide an efficient solution to sequence analysis, with a focus on handling large datasets and delivering prompt results.

# Features
Input Handling: Accepts a file path as a command line argument and processes integers stored in this file.
<br />Sequence Analysis: Identifies the longest increasing and decreasing subsequences within the sequence of integers.
<br />Performance Optimization: Optimized to handle large sequences efficiently and accurately.
<br />Error Handling: Provides clear error messages for missing input or file reading issues.

# Requirements
Java JDK 11 or later

# How to Use
1. Compile the Java program using:
<br />javac Program.java

2. Run the program by providing the path to your input file as a command-line argument:
<br />java Program path/to/your/file.txt
